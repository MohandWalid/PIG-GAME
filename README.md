PIG-GAME is a competitive game for two players. Each player can **roll the dice** on their turn:

- If the dice shows any other number, it is added to the **current score**.
- The player can choose to **Hold** to add the current score to their **total score**.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
